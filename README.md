Pipe line dealer is client for the [pipe line deals api](http://www.pipelinedeals.com/developers/api).

This gem is young. If you want to know anything, just send me a message.

# Acceptance specs
In order to run the acceptance tests agains the actual API, you'll need to provide an API key,
and set the ```ACCEPTANCE=true``` environmental variable.
This can be done either by providing it as another environmental variable ```API_KEY=secret```,
or by adding a file in ```spec/api.key```  with the API key.
