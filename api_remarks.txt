Improvements for pipelinedeals.com:
- DELETE returns 200, and empty string. Could it return a valid JSON response?
- If you try to save an invalid hash, we get a 500. Could this be changed to
  unprocessable entity, and have the same error format as the other requests?
- Make it possible to manage custom fields via the API.
